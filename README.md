### Cooldown Manager Slash Command

It happened to all of us... Midnight patch day... typing `/wa` in chat and nothing happens.. sad times.
This small Addon registers the `/wa` chat command as well as the `/cd` chat command to toggle the Blizzard Cooldown Manager.

Super simple and fail-safe - if WeakAuras should ever return to the game, this Addon file will not execute.

Not vibe coded, no rocket emojies, no trace of AI !
